## Background

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been the gold standard for establishing the efficacy and safety of medical products. With the advent of the the 21^st^ Century Cures Act directive, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established a framework to increasingly include and additionally consider real-world evidence (RWE) generated from routine-care health data such as electronic health records (EHR) to evaluate and contextualize the comparative safety and effectiveness of novel cancer therapies.

However, the validity and transportability of results derived betwen RWE studies and RCTs can depend on many factors and frequently references limitations include missing data, small sample sizes, data discontinuity, rapid changes in guideline treatment patterns and the inability to measure and emulate common eligibility criteria and prognostic factors in RWD.

The RCT DUPLICATE initiative increased our understanding of when RWE studies can come to causal conclusions on treatment effects by comparing results against RCTs under the assumption that each RCT finding reflects a causal treatment effect. In settings where the RCT designs could be emulated well, RWE studies came to the same conclusions. However, prior work from RCT-DUPLICATE has focused primarily on emulating trials in the cardio-metabolic, renal, and pulmonary clinical areas using claims databases.

The [*Emulation of Comparative Oncology Trials with Real-world Evidence* (**ENCORE**)](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/oncology-center-excellence/calibrating-real-world-evidence-studies-oncology-against-randomized-trials-encore) project aims to extend this work to the field of oncology which comes with its own unique set of challenges that are not necessarily comparable with previous learnings from other disease areas and which must be systematically explored and understood.

This repository hosts the manuscript and all associated resources in which we describe the design and process for the selection of the 12 oncology RCTs, the assessment of the database quality and selection, protocol development, study design and statistical analysis and final agreement metrics to evaluate the concordance between RCT and its emulation.
