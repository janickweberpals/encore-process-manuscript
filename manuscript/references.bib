abstract = { e21194Background: Treatment response in clinical trials with solid tumors is measured by applying RECIST1.1 to radiographic images. However, response in real-world data (RWD) studies is based on information abstracted from clinician's notes. Differences in these two approaches can lead to bias when comparing response in trials to RWD. This study investigates the relationship between response from (1) certified radiologists applying RECIST1.1 to images from routine care and (2) electronic health records (EHR) notes-abstraction in the same patients. Methods: The nationwide Flatiron Health (FH) EHR-derived de-identified database was used to identify patients diagnosed with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) on/after Jan 1, 2011, with a visit in the FH network within 90 days of diagnosis, first line treatment (1L), and â¥1 radiographic image both at baseline (8 weeks before or at 1L start) and during 1L. RECIST1.1 and response abstraction were applied retrospectively to images and EHR notes obtained from routine care, respectively. For each patient, time-point responses were determined by RECIST1.1 (rwRECIST) and abstraction (rwR) and dichotomized as unconfirmed best overall response (BOR, complete+partial response = responder, all others = non-responder), and confirmed BOR if patients had an additional assessment. Results: We included 157 patients (59\% on chemotherapy, 15\%/12\% on cancer immunotherapy combination/alone, 10\% on targeted therapies). Patients had an image taken every 11 weeks (median). All images were readable and 75\% were optimal quality. Response rate was lower by rwRECIST than rwR (unconfirmed: 48\% vs 59\%; confirmed: 34\% vs 55\%). Concordance in BOR between rwRECIST and rwR was 68\%/60\% for unconfirmed/confirmed response. Disagreement between rwRECIST and rwR was higher than inter-reader variability between radiologists and was mainly in one direction (rwR higher, Table). The disagreement was driven by patients deemed responders by abstraction who did not meet the -30\% target lesion size cutoff specified by RECIST1.1 or presence of new lesions. Conclusions: RECIST1.1 can be applied to images from aNSCLC routine oncology care, although limited by image availability and less frequent assessment than trials. Differences were observed in response measured by rwRECIST and by abstraction.

    abstract = {The utility of real-world data (RWD) for use as external controls in drug development is informed by studies that replicate trial control arms for different endpoints. The purpose of this study was to replicate control arms from four nonâsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) randomized controlled trials (RCT) to analyze overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall response rate (ORR) using RWD.This study used RWD from a nationwide de-identified database and a clinico-genomic database to replicate OS, PFS, and ORR endpoints in the chemotherapy control arms of four first-line NSCLC RCTs evaluating atezolizumab [IMpower150âwild-type (WT), IMpower130-WT, IMpower131, and IMpower132]. Additional objectives were to develop a definition of real-world PFS (rwPFS) and to evaluate the real-world response rate (rwRR) endpoint.Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were balanced after application of propensity score weighting methods. For rwPFS and OS, RWD external controls were generally similar to their RCT control counterparts. Across all four trials, the hazard ratio (HR) point estimates comparing trial controls with external controls were closer to 1.0 for the PFS endpoint than for the OS endpoint. An exploratory assessment of rwRR in RWD revealed a slight but nonsignificant overestimation of RCT ORR, which was unconfounded by baseline characteristics.RWD can be used to reasonably replicate the OS and PFS of chemotherapy control arms of first-line NSCLC RCTs. Additional studies can provide greater insight into the utility of RWD in drug development.},

    abstract = "{Background: Unmeasured confounding is often raised as a source of potential bias during the design of non-randomized studies but quantifying such concerns is challenging.Methods: We developed a simulation-based approach to assess the potential impact of unmeasured confounding during the study design stage. The approach involved generation of hypothetical individual-level cohorts using realistic parameters including a binary treatment (prevalence 25\\%), a time-to-event outcome (incidence 5\\%), 13 measured covariates, a binary unmeasured confounder (u1, 10\\%), and a binary measured ‘proxy’ variable (p1) correlated with u1. Strength of unmeasured confounding and correlations between u1 and p1 were varied in simulation scenarios. Treatment effects were estimated with, a) no adjustment, b) adjustment for measured confounders (Level 1), c) adjustment for measured confounders and their proxy (Level 2). We computed absolute standardized mean differences in u1 and p1 and relative bias with each level of adjustment.Results: Across all scenarios, Level 2 adjustment led to improvement in balance of u1, but this improvement was highly dependent on the correlation between u1 and p1. Level 2 adjustments also had lower relative bias than Level 1 adjustments (in strong u1 scenarios: relative bias of 9.2\\%, 12.2\\%, 13.5\\% at correlations 0.7, 0.5, and 0.3, respectively versus 16.4\\%, 15.8\\%, 15.0\\% for Level 1, respectively).Conclusion: An approach using simulated individual-level data was useful to explicitly convey the potential for bias due to unmeasured confounding while designing non-randomized studies and can be helpful in informing design choices.}",
