# Background

With 21% of all drug approvals, oncology was the disease area with the most FDA drug approvals in 2023.[@senior2024fresh] Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard, decision-makers increasingly rely on real-world evidence (RWE) generated from routine-care health data such as electronic health records (EHR) to evaluate the comparative safety and effectiveness of novel cancer therapies.[@purpura2022role] Especially in the field of precision oncology, RWE has many essential use cases and plays a critical role in complementing evidence like in patient populations that are underrepresented in RCTs, to construct external control arms in single-arm trials where active recruitment may not be feasible or in drug/biomarker discovery and label extensions among pan-tumor populations that harbor specific genomic signatures. However, [to draw causal inferences from such comparisons in non-randomized data, it is pivotal that endpoints and prognostic information can be measured reliably and at scale]{.underline}, which remains a significant challenge in oncological comparative effectiveness research (CER).
